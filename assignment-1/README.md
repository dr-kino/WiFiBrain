# Phase 1 Description 
Using two Arduinos, and starting from the examples available on the Arduino IDE: 
•	Create a server on port 25 of the first Arduino. Everything that arrives at this server should be sent to the console. 
•	Create a client on the second Arduino and connect it to the first. Everything written in the console should be sent to the server.

# Phase 2 Description
Based on the previous phase:
•	Adjust the code so that it becomes possible to turn on/off the LED of each Arduino using the console of the other Arduino. 
•	Adjust the code so that it becomes possible to know which 802.11 variant (802.11b/g/n) and which channel are being used for the Wi-Fi communication (display that info on the serial console).
•	Adjust the code so that it becomes possible to know the RSSI of the used SSID
